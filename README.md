Create lessons for basic introduction to "what I do" (call for Nicole's children and her friend's children)

1. What do I do? 
- I am a software engineer - fancy way of saying that I write code (or programs) that runs on computers 
- The code I write helps someone else (our customers) do what they need to do more efficiently

2. What does that mean?

- What is a computer?
    4 things common to all computers:
    - take something in (an input)
    - store and process information
    - put something out (output results)

- What is input
    - stuff you tell the computer to make it do stuff

- What is a program?
    - a set of instructions for a computer to follow 

- Can you all think of an example of instructions you have had to follow?
    - if nothing useful - ask about instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
        - ask silly questions - like "well where did the knife come from? what's a drawer?"
        - lead into - you guys know a lot more than computers do; so you have to tell the computer exactly what the instructions it is going to follow. 
    - What is code? 
        - We speak English to each other, but computers can't understand English like we speak it.  We have to instead learn and use programming languages to communicate with computers. 

3. Interactive part 
- makecode editor: `https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor`
    - Create something with the block code editor 
    - Change to javascript or Python and show it's the same program

4. What it can build to - show quick demo of my current job maybe (ie login to a sugar instance or something?)
