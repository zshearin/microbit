Create lessons for basic introduction to "what I do" (call for Nicole's children and her friend's children)

1. What do I do? 
    - I am a software engineer - fancy way of saying that I write code (or programs) that runs on computers 

2. What does that mean?
    - What is a computer?


    4 things common to all computers:
        - take input
        - store information
        - process information
        - output results

    
    - What is input
        - stuff you tell the computer to make it do stuff

    - What makes a computer a computer?

    - What is a program?
        - a set of instructions for a computer to follow 


    - Can you all think of an example of instructions you have had to follow?
        - if nothing useful - ask about instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
            - ask silly questions - like "well where did the knife come from? what's a drawer?"
            - lead into - you guys know a lot more than computers do; so you have to tell the computer exactly what the instructions it is going to follow 
        - say something about how
